Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. My view 
on education begins with that each and every person has the right to be educated. Education allows us to explore 
every aspect of life and can lead us to anywhere we want to go in life. In the earlier times women were not allowed to be 
educated because their parents thought that why to waste money on educating them as they have to give dowery also to 
the groom. Life is a learning experience and education is an important part of this. Even our school also give reservation to 
people(below 18) who cannot afford to spend money in order to educate themselves.
